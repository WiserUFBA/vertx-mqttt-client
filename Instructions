Instructions to run this small project:

1 - Download or clone Project
2 - Open project in your IDE
3 - Run the class Server.  After server started:

MQTT server is listening on port 1883

4 - Run Class PublisherPaho

In Vertx MQTT Server looks that message:


MQTT client [pub-0] request to connect, clean session = false
[will flag = false topic = null msg = null QoS = 0 isRetain = false]
[keep alive timeout = 30]
Subscription for topic with QoS AT_LEAST_ONCE
Just received message on [topic] payload [reactive microservices client paho 0] with QoS [AT_LEAST_ONCE]
aqui
Connection closed
MQTT client [pub-0] request to connect, clean session = true
[username = karaf, password = karaf]
[will flag = false topic = null msg = null QoS = 0 isRetain = false]
[keep alive timeout = 60]
Subscription for REACTIVE with QoS AT_LEAST_ONCE
Just received message on [REACTIVE] payload [reactive microservices client paho 1] with QoS [AT_LEAST_ONCE] 
.....

5 - In the client (PublisherPaho) should run method callback (messageArrived).  
This method (messageArrived) is called when a message arrives from the server.  

In my project the method callback not work but message arrives from the server.  I need support for to resolve this problem.

Thanks.
